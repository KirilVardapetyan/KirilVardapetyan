Heya! ðŸ‘‹ <br>
I am Kiril
I've worked in start-up spheres and I love to discover new technologies which is one of the best advantages of start-ups. My interests are focused on creative and modern start-ups.
For instance, IoT projects where I use different types of hardware technologies and programming languages. Speaking about the hardware I want to mention that I have worked with Raspberry pi and nvidea jetson nano and on them, I've created software with Python and node js. I enjoy networking so much. Also, I have created desktop applications, for which generally I have used the QT framework 
which is intended to create GUIs(Graphic User Interface) with different programming languages but I have mainly used python, JS, and QML. As well as I have specialized in making drones in UAVLAB
LLC. And in the end, I am always open to new challenges and new opportunities.
